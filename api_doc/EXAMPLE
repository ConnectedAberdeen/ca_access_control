Request from community portal sent to access management system asking to allow user access to the internet:

{
    "reqestors_token": "def_community_portal_1263",
    "time": 1440625003,
    "action": "allow_internet",
    "options": {
        "connection_token": "3q874hfpqnq348u4gad",
        "access_tier": 1,
        "valid_until": 1440655002
    }
}

Description:
    requestors_token - token which defines the source of the request - in this case this would be community portal page where user has just logged into and is being granted an access to the internet; this token is assigned as a static string to the web app
    time - unix timestamp of when this request for action has been created
    action - name of the action to be taken
    options - list of options for this particular action
        connection_token - token identifying IP and MAC of the user to be used for the action - this will be provided to the web app as HTTP GET parameter
        access_tier - a specific option for this action - this varies depending on the action
        valid_until - until what time (in unix timestamp) is the effect of the action valid for (e.g. when should we disable access to the internet for the user again)


What will be returned back:

{
    "action_id": 1234,
    "status": "accepted",
    "comment": "action has been accepted to be processed soon"
}

    action_id - an unique ID for this specific action which can then be used to query the status of the request
    status - status of the action - this may be one of "accepted", "done", "rejected"
    comment - comment on the status of the action - this is mostly useful as a free-form explanation of the failed status


Example of getting a current status of the action:

{
    "reqestors_token": "def_community_portal_1263",
    "time": 1440625003,
    "action": "get_action_status",
    "options": {
        "action_id": 1234
    }
}

This is self-explanatory. Returned info will be in the same format as above.
